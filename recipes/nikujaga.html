        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With chunks of potatoes, onion, and thinly sliced beef simmered in savory and sweet dashi broth, Japanese Meat and Potato Stew (Nikujaga) is one of the most iconic home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 package shirataki noodles</li>
            <li>1/2 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or rib eye)</li>
            <li>8 pieces snow peas</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral-flavoured oil</li>
            <li>2 cups dashi</li>
            <li>4 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sake</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Cut the sliced meat in half about 3 inch (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion in half and into ½-inch (1.3 cm) wedges.</li>
            <li>Peel the carrot and cut it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Here, I use a Japanese cutting technique called Rangiri, where we cut the carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter between cuts. This helps to create more surface spaces so it will cook faster and absorb more flavors.</li>
            <li>Cut each potato into quarters.</li>
            <li>Remove the sharp edges of the potatoes with a knife to create smooth corners. Soak the potatoes in water to remove starch. Tip: We call this Japanese cutting technique "mentori". This prevents the potatoes from breaking into pieces. If the potato has sharp edges, they are likely to bump into each other and break easily while simmering.</li>
            <li>Remove strings from snow peas.</li>
            <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt. Add the snow peas.</li>
            <li>Cook them in boiling water for 1 minute and take them out.</li>
            <li>Drain shirataki noodles from the package and roughly cut them in half. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 1 minute to remove the unwanted smell.</li>
            <li>Drain well and set aside. Cut the thinly-sliced beef into 3 pieces (depending on the size).</li>
            <li>In a large pot (I used a 4-QT Staub Cocotte), heat oil on medium heat and sauté the onion.</li>
            <li>When the onion is coated with oil, add the meat and cook until no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and coat them well with cooking liquid. Tip: This coating will prevent the potatoes from breaking.</li>
            <li>Add the carrot and shirataki noodles and mix them all together.</li>
            <li>Add dashi and make sure it's just enough to cover the ingredients (it doesn't have to fully cover the ingredients).</li>
            <li>Cover to cook. Once boiling, with a fine-mesh skimmer, skim the scum and foam.</li>
            <li>Add the seasonings (sugar, sake, soy sauce, and mirin).</li>
            <li>Mix all together and place an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Simmer on low heat for 12-14 minutes, or until a skewer pierces through a potato easily. Tip: The otoshibuta is necessary to maintain the shape of the vegetables. They bump into each other and break easily when they are loose. Do not mix the ingredients while cooking; the otoshibuta will help the flavor circulate automatically.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and remove the otoshibuta. Ideally, let it stand (uncovered) for 30-60 minutes before serving. The flavors will soak into the ingredients while cooling down.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to serve nikujaga, add the blanched snow peas to the pot and cover to reheat on medium heat. When simmering, reduce the heat and let it simmer for a few minutes. Tip: Add the snow peas right before serving to keep the bright color.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve Nikujaga with some cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container or in the pot and store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Nikujaga tastes even better on the second day! To freeze, remove the potatoes as they change the texture when frozen. You can keep it in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
